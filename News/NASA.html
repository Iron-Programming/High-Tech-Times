        <div class="mainArticleContent">
          <h5 class="bodyTextHeading">Introduction</h5>
          <p class="articleBodyText">
              In this article, we will talk about two of NASA's most exciting developments. First we will talk about their recent rover on mars, Perserverance. Then we will talk about their newer project, the James Webb Space Telescope. 
          </p>

          <h5 class="bodyTextHeading">NASA's Perserverance Rover</h5>
          <p>
              The Perserverance Rover is a continuation of NASA's exploration of Mars, with the overall theme of searching for any possibility of life on Mars, or possible history of it. 
              <br>With the scientific data that the Perserverance rover gives, humans could be better prepared for human exploration trips on Mars, with the ultimate goal of possibly colonizing Mars. 
              <br>Of course, these things take time, and so there is not immediate results for these types of projects. But all great projects must start with simple tasks, which in this case are not so simple, as these rovers are incredibly complex. 
              <br>For programmers and engineers, it is a puzzle to try to create the appropriate hardware and software with the given limitations. Programmers try to squeeze algorithms as much as possible, and reduce the storage space required as well. We don't have all of the nice convniences of normal computers on Earth, so we have to make every bit count.
              <br>Anyway, NASA has some recordings from their Perserverance rover, so I thought I would show some interesting ones here.

          <h5 class="bodyTextHeading">Summary</h5>
          <p>For many people, NASA might not be at the top of their minds. Politics and other concerns weigh on their mind. But NASA has some epic projects that they have launched recently, and it is truly exciting to see what will come from them.
              <br>Until next time!
