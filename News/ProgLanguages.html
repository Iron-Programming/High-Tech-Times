                <h5 class="bodyTextHeading">Introduction</h5>
                <p class="articleBodyText">
                    There are many programming languages to choose from, each with their pros and cons. Some languages, such as Fortran and C, go far back near to the origins of programming languages, and are still popular today. Like real life languages, programming languages are related and can be grouped in a tree structure. They also change, or evolve, over time, making programming tricky is the same way that a grammarian must work with defining words properly.
                    <br>Programming languages are said to have four control structures which let us configure any type of algorithm we wish: sequences, loops, subprograms, and conditionals. Some programming languages are high-level (meaning they are closer to human languages), and others are low-level (meaning they are not in person-friendly terms, more like machine language).
                    <br>Anyway, let's delve into some of the popular programming languages that you should be aware of today!
                </p>

                <h5 class="bodyTextHeading">Popular Programming Languages</h5>
                <p class="articleBodyText">
                    One of first high-level languages that took off was FORTRAN, developed by IBM in 1954. Other popular languages around this type included BASIC and COBOL.
                    <br>Not too long after this, C was developed. C is considered one of the first biggest high-level languages that served as the basis for many other popular programming languages and system software, such as various operating systems.
                    <br>C was created in 1972 by Dennis Ritchy, and is the basis for Python, PHP, C#, and C++, all very popular programming languages today.
                    <br>Like mentioned, several programming languages were derived from C. C++ was specalized because it specialized in Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP).
                    <br>PHP specailizes with server-side development, and is used to create both static and dynamic websites. PHP commonly works with query languages such as Oracle or MySQL. C# became a popular option for many web solutions. Out of all of these though, Python became the most popular. One of Python's biggest points is it simplicity. It is considered one of the most readable and human friendly languages there is.
                    <br>Java came out by Sun Microsystems in 1995, and is one of the most popular programming languages out today as well. It is known for working well on all platforms, as it can run anywhere on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This feature of portability makes Java a very flexbile language.
                    <br>As far as programming languages go, we wouldn't be complete without talking about SQL. Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard programming language used for interacting with relational databases. Note that SQL is often pronounced as <em>s-e-q-u-e-l</em>.
                    <br>JavaScript is also a very popular language, and is used primarily for web development to create the scripts necessary to make web pages interactive.
                </p>

                <h5 class="bodyTextHeading">Specialized Programming Languages</h5>
                <p class="articleBodyText">
                    Several programming languages have been developed for specific purposes. There are a couple in particular that I found fascinating that I didn't want to leave out of this article.
                    <strong>MatLab</strong> is a programming language that was designed specifically for (guess what) Math. It lets you analyze data, develop algorithsm, and create models and applications. If you are into advanced math such as Linear Algebra, College Statistics, or Multlivairable Calculus, then this language is definitely worth checking out.
                    <strong>R</strong> is a programming language built specifically for statistics. Like MatLab, they both focus on math, but R focuses primarily on analyzing statistics.
                    Anyway, I wanted to add those two in because they are really cool in my opinion. Now it is time to look at all these languages in a bigger picture.
                </p>

                <h5 class="bodyTextHeading">Overview</h5>
                <p class="articleBodyText">
                    There are many popular programming languages to choose from today. Some are built for specific purposes, such as math, security, or a specific suite of software. Others, such as Java, are made to work as cross-platform apps so that they are very flexible. Regardless of which language you choose to work with, all programming languages use the same underlying concepts, so once you learn one then all others will be easier.
                    Let's look at a summary of what we have talked about.
